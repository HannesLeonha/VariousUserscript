# Various userscript
A collection of userscripts I have made to improve my web experience

## Current scripts
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Google Ai Eradicator</td>
    <td>It removes the ai overview when searching in google and the "Try gemini" button from gmail</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Installation
You will need to install a browser extension that can inject these scripts into websites. I can recommend [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) or [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) for this

### Automatic installation
You can install all of these by heading to my Greasyfork page, finding the script you're looking for and clicking on the install button on it's subpage.

### Manual installation
You can download the script you are interested in directly from my GitHub and look up how to install the userscript into your chosen browser extension.
